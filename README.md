# Bioinformatics Guides
Here are some bits of advice I find sharing frequently, so I set this repository up as a central collection of pages to update and refer people to.

This will focus on bioinformatics, particularly using R.

- [overlaps](overlaps.md): If you have sets of peaks or genes, someone will want to see a Venn diagram of them.
- [public_data_sources](public_data_sources.md): How to find public data, beyond GEO.
- [rna-seq](nascent_edgeR_pipeline.Rmd): An example RNA-seq pipeline, using [EdgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html).
- [dplyr and pipes](http://seananderson.ca/2014/09/13/dplyr-intro.html): If you're not already using the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) and this pipe: `%>%`, this short guide will change how you code in R for the better.
- [converting_gene_ids](converting_gene_ids.md): For converting between [entrez](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK184582/), [refseq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/), [ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html), and gene symbols.
