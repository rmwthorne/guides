# Bioinformatics Guides
Here are some bits of advice I find sharing frequently, so I set this repository up as a central collection of pages to update and refer people to.

This will focus on bioinformatics, particularly using R.

- [overlaps](overlaps.md): If you have sets of peaks or genes, someone will want to see a Venn diagram of them.
- [public_data_sources](public_data_sources.md): How to find public data, beyond GEO.
- [rna-seq](nascent_edgeR_pipeline.Rmd): An example RNA-seq pipeline, using [EdgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html).
